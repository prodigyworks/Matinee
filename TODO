New calendar events report
When I click on an existing appointment I cannot edit any of the info in there
Can we have an all-day option when creating an appointment please?
When clicking on a date in the select calendar it reverses the date format on the visible calendars
How do I create a multi-day appointment please? I.e. one of the Studio may be booked for several days on a single project with the same engineer
When you drag an appointment to half an hour it displays the HTML
Can the grey portion at the bottom of the page be smaller please
